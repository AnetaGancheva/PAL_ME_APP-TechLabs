# palMe
palMe is an application for connecting sports enthusiasts in an area.

## Description
Firstly, fork or copy the Github repo locally. Then run
```bash
npm install
```
to install all necessary packages.
Then run the application:
```bash
npm start
```

## About the application
palMe has been created within the TechLabs 2021-22 program. Its main purpose is to be able to connect people who want to do sports together in the Netherlands (and possibly all around the world). 
Currently, due to time and manpower constraints, the application serves only a functional front-end with very basic back-end. UX research has been conducted and implemented in the front-end design.
The findaplayer.com website served us as a template and inspiration.
We do not intend to profit from this project and it has been created for educational purposes only.
